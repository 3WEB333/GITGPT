The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is India's central banking institution, responsible for regulating the country's monetary policy and controlling the supply of money. The Bhagavad Gita, on the other hand, is a sacred Hindu text that contains spiritual teachings on life and the nature of the self.

While the RBI and the Bhagavad Gita may seem unrelated, there have been instances where the central bank has drawn upon the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita to inform its policies and decision-making.

For example, in a speech given in 2017, the former Deputy Governor of the RBI, S S Mundra, drew upon the Bhagavad Gita to emphasize the importance of transparency and accountability in banking. Mundra spoke about the concept of "karma yoga" from the Bhagavad Gita, which emphasizes the importance of doing one's duty without attachment to the fruits of one's labor. He related this concept to the banking sector, stating that bankers have a duty to act in the best interests of their customers and society as a whole, rather than solely for their own gain.

In another example, the RBI has also drawn upon the concept of "dharma" from the Bhagavad Gita to inform its financial inclusion policies. The concept of dharma emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's social and moral duties, and the RBI has used this concept to underscore the importance of providing financial services to underserved and marginalized communities.

Overall, while the RBI's relationship with the Bhagavad Gita may not be direct, the central bank has drawn upon the teachings of the text to inform its policies and decision-making in certain instances.</p>
